    <h1>Simulation Add In</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This tool is to support using Excel as a front end for AutoMod(TM) simulation models.</p>
    <p>Generally, it is expected that the model already exists when starting this tool, but that is not required.</p>

    <p> The first thing you will want to do (after adding the add-in to Excel) is to initialize a new project from the ribbon command Initialize.</p>
    <h1>Quick Start</h1>
    <p>You can set up a new UI in just a few quick steps:</p>
    <p>1) open a new Excel file</p>
    <p>2) Click on "Initialize"</p>
    <p>3) Identify the path that contains the models .exe file</p>
    <p>4) Select the model itself</p>
    <p>5) Save the Excel file</p>
    <p>6) Select Run</p>
